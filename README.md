# pandas-challenge

I imported pandas, pathlib and numpy, then loaded/read the excel sheets with the student and school data.
I then merged the two excel sheets and printed the first five rows.
I did some calculations with the data and created a data frame summarizing the district. (Total students, budget, schools, average math and reading scores).

I repeated the same calculations but parsed the data differently (by type, spending and size).
